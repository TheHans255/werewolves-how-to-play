# Tanner

The Tanner is a solo-evil neutral player. The Tanner hates their job, the village is forcing them to do it, and they want out.

The Tanner's goal is to trick the village into lynching them. If they are lynched, the game immediately ends and the Tanner wins.

## Role Type

- The Tanner is seen as a Neutral Party by the Seer.
- The Tanner is not seen as a user of witchcraft.
- The Tanner does not have a night action so will not be seen visiting by the Harlot/Stalker/Familiar.
- The Tanner is not seen as a killer by the Adjudicator.

## Notes

- The Tanner is only used in Speed Games.
- The Tanner is one of the default roles granted to speed game hosts, alongside the Seer and the Werewolf.
- The Tanner only wins if they are lynched. Being killed at night does not count, nor do they win if the other evil factions die before they do.
- The Tanner cannot be recruited by sub-faction leaders (Mason, Inquisition, Illuminati). However, they can be recruited by a Vampire or Vampire Master.
- If a game contains multiple Tanners, only the Tanner that manages to get themselves lynched wins - the other Tanners do not win with this Tanner,
  and the group of Tanners do not share a night chat.

## Tips

- Tanners are a danger to the evil factions as well as the village. Don't rely on evils being happy to bandwagon a vote against you if you are too obvious.
