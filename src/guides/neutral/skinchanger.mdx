# Tanner

The Skinchanger is a solo-evil neutral player. Its goal is to eliminate the entire village, both villagers and evils, and it has the ability to shapeshift into each victim it claims.

## Role Type

- The Skinchanger is seen as a Malevolent Spirit by the Seer.
- The Skinchanger is not seen as a user of witchcraft.
- The Skinchanger will be seen visiting by the Harlot/Stalker/Familiar.
- The Skinchanger is seen as a killer by the Adjudicator.
- The Skinchanger is night immune - it cannot be killed at night, roleblocked, or redirected.

## Notes

- The Skinchanger is much like a Vampire in that it acts alone, can kill once each night, and is night immune. The Skinchanger, however, has no power to recruit additional members to its faction and does not possess a night chat.
- Instead, whenever the Skinchanger kills a player, it has the option to shift into them, in the same way a Shapeshifter werewolf would. When it does this, the Skinchanger assumes the identity of its target, who will appear to die in the Skinchanger's old body.
- There is no limit to the number of times a Skinchanger may shift.
- The Skinchanger must shift at least once every three days in order to survive. If it fails to shift for 3 nights in a row, it will die the 4th night, similar to the Maple Wolf.
- The Skinchanger itself is night immune, but its kills can be protected against by a Protector or a similar role. If a Huntsman blocks a Skinchanger's kill, the Huntsman will be killed instead and no shift will occur, even if one was attempted.
- Skinchangers _are_ counted as evils in parity checks. The village, and other evils in the village, must eliminate you in order to win.
- If a game contains multiple Skinchangers, each is aligned independently and must eliminate the others to win. Note that, as night-immune players, Skinchangers cannot deal with each other by killing each other at night.

## Tips

- With your ability to shift at will, you are notoriously hard to catch. Your opponents will essentially be forced to deal with you immediately as soon as they find information that locates you - do whatever you can to delay your execution so that you can shift at nightfall.
- Once you have been found, Stalkers are your worst enemy - they can see you visit your target and will thus be able to follow you into the next day, even if you shift. This is especially pertinent as most factions possess some kind of Stalker role, and those that don't may be given a Fj√§t Rune to track you down.
- Skinchangers are often given items to help balance the fact that they are alone. One especially helpful item is the Iron Collar, which protects you from a single lynch. Other, less powerful items are also useful in throwing off a Stalker, as they generate additional visits alongside the killing visit.
- More so than with any other role, you will want to take care that others do not notice the change in player. Players will take note of things like typing styles, voting and activity patterns, and of course past claims, including any information received on the night of the shift (which you will not be able to see). Since you are night immune, you will also fail to see attempts to roleblock you, and since you will be attacking evil factions, they will also notice as their members disappear from their night chats or fail to give code words when they appear for the day. If you do not feel you can safely shift a player, you should kill them normally instead.
