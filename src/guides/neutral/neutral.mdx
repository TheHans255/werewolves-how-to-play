# Neutral Roles

The Neutral Roles are held by players who, either permanently or temporarily, are not aligned with any other faction of players having the same win condition,
but instead act independently. 

Neutral roles fall into two major categories. The first category, which includes roles like the Drunk and Graverobber, have players work as free agents
with other factions, usually ending up with a faction-aligned role and playing amicably to the factions they want to join until then. The second category, which
includes roles like the Tanner and Skinchanger, consists of solo evil players who are attempting to defeat all other factions in the village via their own
win conditions.

Neutral players, unless otherwise stated on their role pages, are not counted as evils for the sake of parity checks. If the remaining village population
consists only of villagers and such neutral players, the game will end in a village victory (which usually means a loss for the neutral player if they have
not accomplished their win condition). However, some neutrals, usually solo evil players, _are_ counted as evils in parity checks and must be eliminated
in order for the village to win.
